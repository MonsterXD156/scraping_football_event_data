# Querying Football Matches for Event Data: Towards using Large Language Models

Football, being one of the most popular sports in the world,
has attracted significant attention from researchers exploring the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In particular, Large Language Models
(LLMs), exemplified by digital assistants such as ChatGPT, have proven
their capabilities and offer a potentially effective avenue for football research. However, accessibility of football data remains a challenge, as the
datasets collected by providers are often inaccessible. This case study
presents a proof-of-concept that addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative web scraping approach to extract football event data
and making it accessible e.g. for scientific research with LLMs. To this
end, the extracted data is structured into coherent sentences for linguistic compatibility. The results show the successful integration of LLMs
with football event data, enabling the extraction of information through
retrieval-augmented generation. This work makes a first contribution to
the field by bridging the gap between football and LLMs, demonstrating
the potential for further analysis.
